    <h1>The inside story: Why is Oh Noes so sad?</h1>

    <p>
      We had an exclusive interview with Oh Noes guy, the error buddy, and we
      asked him the question that all of you were wondering about: "Why do you
      always seem so sad?" Here's his shocking reply:
    </p>
    <p id="ohnoes-says">I'm not always sad.Its just my facial expression.</p>

    <p>We asked Winston for comment, and this is all he would say about it:</p>
    <p id="winston-says">
      Its very posssible for someone to have such facial expression
    </p>
    <script>
      var ohnoesSays = document.getElementById("ohnoes-says");
      var winstonSays = document.getElementById("winston-says");
      ohnoesSays.innerHTML =
        "I'm not always <strong>sad</strong>. Its just my <em>facial expression</em>.";
      winstonSays.textContent =
        "Its very posssible for someone to have such facial expression";
    </script>
  </body>
