        <p>A lifestyle blog is best defined as a digital content representation of its author’s everyday life and 
            interests. A lifestyle blogger creates content inspired and curated by their personal interests and daily 
            activities. As such, lifestyle blogs are oftentimes highly personalized to the author’s location, life stage 
            and experience. For instance, a former food magazine editor, married, in her mid-30s with a 1-yr old child 
            residing in Nantucket will blog on vastly different categories than a single, 24-yr old lifestyle blogger living in San Diego, 
            who designs bikinis for work. Both are considered lifestyle bloggers, but there will be little if no overlay in their lifestyle blog content.

            Lifestyle bloggers share a broad variety of content centered around and inspired by their personal lives — most 
            notably family, home, travel, beauty, food, recipes, fashion, makeup, design and decor. This style of broad 
            content sharing inspired directly from their lives differs drastically from fashion blogs, mom blogs, and other 
            more segmented, niched blogs in that they tend to always share a wide mix of content across other blog categories.
            
            Because of their audience reach, lifestyle bloggers are prodigious social influencers as well, commanding large 
            influencer outreach across social influence channels such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other emerging 
            social media channel.
            What began as a fashion influencer blog or beauty blog has now become a lifestyle blog seamlessly integrating 
            and touching upon everyday life topics ranging from cooking to family activities to home design and travel.

            <p>Planning a trip to one of the destinations on your travel bucket-list? Or did you make an impromptu 
                getaway plan for your weekend? Well, things get exciting when planning a holiday, until when you 
                have to pause the enthusiasm to pack! Trying to think about how to put those OOTDs and must-haves 
                into your travel bag. If you still haven’t figured out how to make that duffel bag fit as underseat 
                luggage, or how to fit all your needed stuff in your travel bag, today, we’ve got something really 
                helpful to include in your trip planning. There’s an easy knack to packing right and packing smart. 
                Actually, there is a fine balance. So brace yourself, coming up are our top tips on how to pack 
                travel bag like a pro<br>
                <strong>Step1</strong><br>
                Before you start packing, think about what you just need to pack in your travel bag. Consider the weather, the activities 
                you plan to do, and of course, the duration of your stay. 
                Your travel bag says a lot about you, and one of them, unwittingly, is whether you’re smart or otherwise.We all know about 
                not bringing the closet when you travel. And there’s actually 
                a smart addition to that: pack the right type and the right number of clothes. You can easily achieve this by 
                having a checklist for your daily outfits. Travelers and backpackers are known to be minimalists, and there’s 
                a good reason for that! Remember to pack what you must have and not pack those that are nice to have. Again, 
                travel bags aren’t close. In your checklist, consider how many days will you spend on a holiday 
                or vacation trip. Don’t bring weeklong stuff when you’re only traveling for two days! You also 
                need to list down the travel accessories and toiletries you have to bring. You can avoid overpacking 
                your travel bag by doing this simple tip. <br>
                <strong>Step2</strong><br>
                Now you have listed all that you need and now you’re ready to pack your travel bay. 
                Next, lay down all the things you want to take on your bed or on the floor in an organized 
                manner. Group the items according to their type. This will make the work actual packing easier 
                and faster!<br>
                <strong>Step3</strong><br>
                When you stick to simple, but matching colors, your style never goes wrong! Get at 
                least two neutral colors and pair it with three color shades. You can slay the whole 
                week with different outfits by doing this. Make sure those colors match your shoes’ colors!<br>
                <strong>Step4</strong><br>
                Bringing thinner and stretchy fabrics is also helpful in packing your travel bag. 
                Consider bringing leggings or stretchy pants than the regular denim as those garments 
                usually use lesser space in travel bags. If you’re traveling to a colder place, you can 
                replace two tops for two sweaters instead of bringing them all. Bring warm underwear and socks, 
                and boots as one of your shoes.Always put this as one of your priorities in your trip planning. 
                Choosing the right travel bag depends on what you plan to bring or how you intend to pack your clothes. 
                If you’re on a business trip, then you can bring a Duffle bag or a suitcase. But, for a beach or a 
                casual vacation, you could choose a backpack. Now we proceed on the actual packing. 
                Start with your shoes by putting them at the bottom of your travel bag. 
                Roll your socks, underwear, swimsuit and tuck them inside the shoes. 
                Make sure you use every inch of the space so you’ll have more space for other 
                stuff. If they all don’t fit in the shoes, you can use the spaces between them. 
                Jewelry, glasses, gloves, and similar items can also be stuff inside the shoes.
                Seasoned travelers say it’s better to roll clothes than fold them up because it 
                saves you more space. Rolling clothes also make your travel bag organized and 
                easier to access as you can readily pick what you want to use. Rolled clothes 
                are less prone to wrinkles and creases! However, others say that rolling up clothes 
                is the way for backpackers who would want to carry a nice and minimal travel bag that 
                can qualify as under seat luggage. Folding, they say, should be done when using a suitcase 
                or a Duffle bag for travel. The top tip is you fold them nicely and completely flat. Make 
                sure you put the clothes you would want to wear first at the top of the layer so you don’t have 
                to dig through everything every time!<br>
                <strong>Final Step</strong><br>
                
                So you think you now have a light travel bag ready for the holiday trip? Nuh, don’t be so sure. 
                Take it to a test drive! Carry your bag for a while. For a suitcase, try carrying the handle 
                and walk to the street and back to your house. Lug it up and down the stairs. If you get exhausted 
                in just a few tests, then time to unload more.

                 <h4><li>MAKE TODAY COUNT BY JOHN.C.MAXWELL BOOK REVIEW</li></h4>
                
                 <img src="johnmax.jpg" alt= "blog pic" width="500" class="blogimg">
                 <p>The first book I picked up this year was Make Today Count: The Secret of Your Success Is 
                     Determined by Your Daily Agenda written by my mentor and friend, John C. Maxwell.  
                     This phenomenal book has forever changed the way I treat the gift called today.
                    In Make Today Count, John Maxwell taught that you can build a better life if you learn to:making good decisions, and
                    discipline yourself to manage the decision daily
                    To help you make today count, John dedicated the 12 chapters of the book to the 
                    “Daily Dozen:” 12 critical areas that can make your life a masterpiece if you can make good decisions in each of 
                     these areas and discipline yourself daily to manage your decisions. Here are the Daily Dozens for success, John Maxwell’s 
                     decision in each area, and how he managed the discipline of each decision.
                    <br>
                   <strong>1. Attitude</strong> <br>
                    To make today count, you have to make a decision to keep a positive attitude and 
                    use it to influence others. If you want today to be a good day, you need to take charge 
                    of the way you look at it. To benefit from your decision to keep a positive attitude, you 
                    need to determine that every day, you will make the adjustments necessary to keep your 
                    attitude right.<br>
                    
                    <strong>2. Priorities</strong>
                    Another thing you need to do to make today count is to prioritize your life and give 
                    focus and energy to those things that gives the highest return. To benefit from your 
                    decision to prioritize your life, you need to determine that every day, you will live 
                    your life according to your priorities.<br>
                    
                    <strong>3. Health</strong><br>
                    If you are serious about making today count, you will have to take good care of 
                    yourself by exercising and eating right. This is one area I personally need to work on.
                     It’s a wise saying that health is wealth, if you are weak or sick in your body, it will 
                     greatly affect your productivity. To benefit from the decision to take good care of yourself, 
                     you need to determine that every day, you will eat low-fat foods and exercise for at least 
                     thirty-five minutes.
                    
                    A lot of people count the day instead of making the day count<br>
                    
                   <strong>4. Family</strong><br>
                    You can also make today count if those closest to you respect you the most. 
                    While you cannot demand respect from family members, you can earn it by determining 
                    that every day, you will will work hard on gaining the respect of those closest to you. 
                    John Maxwell admonish that “building a solid family doesn’t just happen on its own, you 
                    have to work at it. It’s okay to aspire to be successful but it should not be at the cost 
                    of your family. “Anyone who neglects or abandons his family for fame, status, or financial 
                    gain isn’t really successful.”<br>
                    
                   <strong>5. Thinking</strong><br>
                    All that you will will achieve or fail to achieve is the direct result of your 
                    thoughts. So, to make today count, you have to decide that you will think on things 
                    that will add value to you and to others. Dr. Maxwell encourages that you find a thinking 
                    place to capture your thoughts and write down your ideas. Ideas have a short half-life, 
                    “the more time that passes after the idea strikes, the less heat it gives off. To benefit 
                    from your decision to think on things that will add value to you and to others, you need to 
                    determine that every day, you will set aside a time to think and think on the right things.<br>
                    
                   <strong> 6. Commitment</strong><br>
                    Another decision to make your today count is to decide that if 
                    something is worth doing, you will commit yourself to carrying it through. 
                    “Everything in life exacts a price, you have to decide whether the price is worth the prize.”
                     Your commitment becomes stronger when you have already count the cost and determine to pay 
                     the price. To benefit from the decision to commit yourself to carry through, you must determine 
                     that every day I will renew my commitment and think about the benefits that come from it.
                    
                    You already know how to count your days, right now is the time to make your days count. 
                    In John Maxwell’s words, “when you take care of today, tomorrow will take care of itself.”
