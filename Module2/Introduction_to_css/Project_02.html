    <h1>MALDIVES(A place you should visit)</h1>
    <h2>About Maldives</h2>
    <p id="about">
      The <em>Maldives</em>, officially the Republic of Maldives, <br />
      is a small island nation in South Asia, situated in the Arabian <br />
      Sea of the Indian Ocean. It lies southwest of Sri Lanka and India,<br />
      about <strong>700 kilometres</strong> from the Asian continent's mainland
    </p>

    <h2>Maldives Location</h2>
    <p class="maldives">
      Strung across the <strong>Indian Ocean southwest</strong> of India and Sri
      Lanka,<br />
      the 26 natural atolls of the Maldives exude an almost surreal <br />
      beauty due, in large part, to the luminous blue waters that <br />
      surround them. If slipping into the crystal-clear, soul-warming<br />
      sea is a top criteria for your perfect tropical vacation, this<br />
      is the place to do it, as water comprises 99 percent of the <br />
      Maldives. Paradoxically, it also threatens to inundate the shores <br />
      of this low-lying island nation.
    </p>

    <h2>Tourism at Maldives</h2>
    <p class="maldives">
      The <em>Maldives</em> remained largely unknown to tourists until the
      <br />
      early 1970s. Only 189 islands are home to its 447,137<br />
      inhabitants. The other islands are used entirely for <br />
      economic purposes, of which tourism and agriculture are the<br />
      most dominant. Tourism accounts for 28% of the GDP and more <br />
      than 60% of the Maldives' foreign exchange receipts. <br />
      Over 90% of government tax revenue comes from import duties<br />
      and tourism-related taxes.

    <h2>Maldives Fishing Industry</h2>
    <p class="maldives">
      For many centuries the <em>Maldivian</em> economy was entirely <br />
      dependent on fishing and other marine products. Fishing <br />
      remains the main occupation of the people and the government<br />
      gives priority to the fisheries sector.

    <h2>You want to visit Maldives, You are very welcome</h2>
    <p class="maldives">
      Visitors to the <em>Maldives</em> do not need to apply for a visa <br />
      pre-arrival, regardless of their country of origin, provided<br />
      they have a valid passport, proof of onward travel, and the<br />
      money to be self-sufficient while in the country.
