          <strong>Paris</strong>, France's capital, is a major European city and
          a global center for art, fashion, gastronomy and culture. Its
          19th-century cityscape is crisscrossed by wide boulevards and the
          River Seine. Beyond such landmarks as the Eiffel Tower and the
          12th-century, Gothic Notre-Dame cathedral, the city is known for its
          cafe culture and designer boutiques along the Rue du Faubourg
          Saint-Honor√©.

          An immense mausoleum of white marble, built in Agra between 1631 and
          1648 by order of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his
          favourite wife, the <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> is the jewel of Muslim
          art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the
          world's heritage.

          Egypt, a country linking northeast Africa with the Middle East, dates
          to the time of the pharaohs. Millennia-old monuments sit along the
          fertile Nile River Valley, including Giza's colossal Pyramids and
          Great Sphinx as well as Luxor's hieroglyph-lined Karnak Temple and
          Valley of the Kings tombs. The capital, Cairo, is home to Ottoman
          landmarks like Muhammad Ali Mosque and the Egyptian Museum, a trove of
          antiquities.
